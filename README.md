# Emmerce CRM Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the Emmerce CRM application! This is a mini CRM system designed to help agents track their leads. The frontend is built using **Vue 3** with the **Composition API** and **Vuetify** for UI components. It communicates with the backend built with Django and Django REST Framework to manage leads, contacts, notes, and reminders.

```

Or if you are using **yarn**:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start a local server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project structure:

- `src/`: Contains all the application source code.
  - `assets/`: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
  - `components/`: Reusable Vue components.
  - `views/`: Views like `Leads`, `Contacts`, `Dashboard`, etc.
  - `store/`: Pinia stores for state management.
  - `router/`: Vue Router configuration for navigation.
  - `plugins/`: Axios plugin for API calls and other utility plugins.

---

## Authentication

The frontend uses JWT-based authentication for user login and token refresh.

- **Login**: Users can log in with their email and password, and receive an access token and a refresh token.
- **Token Refresh**: When the access token expires, a refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token.

Ensure that the backend has JWT authentication set up.

---

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the backend using the following main API endpoints:

- **Login**: `/api/auth/login/` (POST)
- **Logout**: `/api/auth/logout/` (POST)
- **Register**: `/api/auth/register/` (POST)
- **Leads**: `/api/leads/` (GET, POST), `/api/leads/{id}/` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Contacts**: `/api/contacts/` (GET, POST), `/api/contacts/{id}/` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Notes**: `/notes/` (GET, POST), `/api/notes/{id}/` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Reminders**: `/reminders/` (GET, POST), `/api/reminders/{id}/` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

All API calls are handled by **Axios** through a custom plugin that adds JWT tokens to request headers automatically.
